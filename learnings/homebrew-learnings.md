# Homebrew Learnings

Homebrew is "the missing package manager for macOS".
Homebrew is at https://brew.sh/.

Installing Homebrew is copy-pasting and running one command mentioned prominently
on the home page.

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
